# Battleship

~ To play the game ~

Download the DotComGame folder. 
Import the project to eclipse.
Run DotComBust class.

~ Goal ~

Sink all of the computer's Dot Coms in the fewest number of guesses:
You're given a rating level based on how well you perform.

~Setup~

When the program is launched, the computer places thre Dot Coms,randomly on the virtual 7x7 grid. when that's complete, the game asks for your first guess.

~How you play~

The computer will prompt you to enter a gess(a cell), which you will type at the command-line
(as "A3","C5",etc). In response to your guesses, you'll see a result at the command line either "hit",
"miss" or "You sink the Pets.com"(or whatever your lucky Dot Com of the day is). when you've sent all three Dot Coms to that 404 sky,the game ends by printing out your rating.

//Disclaimer

I don't neither own this game nor code.
I learnt it as my java practice.
